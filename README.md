# CitySagas_3
<h1>Bootstrap Project</h1>

<p>This is an update to the CitySagas blog-style website. There are modals and many other BS features being used, but ideally,<br>
I want to add some JS and/or JQ, as well as some backend behaviours using PHPmyadmin</p> 

Updates coming soon. Thanks, 

EJeffery
